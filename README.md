# Linear_Regression_OLS_vs_Gradient_Descent
The objective of this notebook is to compare the methodologies used in linear regression: traditional statistical techniques versus machine learning optimization methods, such as gradient descent.
- First, I will demonstrate the statistical approach using a single variable.
- Next, I will show how to perform regression with two variables using matrix operations—a method that generalizes easily to more variables.
- Then, I will replicate the same procedure using a machine learning approach, specifically gradient descent.
- Finally, I will conclude by discussing the relevance of this methodological comparison for the field of data science and how it opens new possibilities for applying deep learning techniques.

While traditional statistical methods like Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) provide efficient closed-form solutions for linear regression, they become **impractical** or **infeasible** for more complex models and large datasets.

This is where **Gradient Descent (GD)** plays a crucial role.

### Why Gradient Descent Matters

Gradient Descent is a **general-purpose optimization algorithm** that allows us to minimize a wide range of cost functions, even when:
- The model has **many parameters**,
- The cost function is **non-convex** or **nonlinear**,
- A closed-form solution is either **intractable** or **does not exist**.

It offers flexibility and scalability, making it suitable for training models far more complex than simple linear regression.

### Enabling Deep Learning

Modern **deep learning**—involving neural networks with **millions of parameters** and **nonlinear activation functions**—would not be possible without gradient-based optimization.

Since there is no closed-form solution for training deep neural networks, algorithms like **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** and its variants (e.g., Adam, RMSProp) are used to iteratively update parameters and minimize the loss function.

In essence, **gradient descent is the backbone of deep learning**. Without it, training models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and transformers would simply not be feasible.

### Summary

- **Closed-form solutions** are elegant but limited in scope.
- **Gradient descent** generalizes optimization to a wide range of models.
- It has **enabled the modern AI revolution**, making it possible to train deep learning models that solve complex real-world problems—from image recognition to natural language understanding.

By understanding gradient descent in the context of linear regression, we gain insight into the **foundational technique** powering today's most advanced machine learning systems.
